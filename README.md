# Edinburgh Napier University SET07109 C/C++ Exercises

**DISCLAIMER:** No one should blindly copy code from this repository (or anywhere really). Use this if you are stuck or just curious about my solution.

This repository contains my solutions to Haskell exercises given on [Programming Fundamentals SET07109 module in Edinburgh Napier University](http://www.modules.napier.ac.uk/Module.aspx?ID=SET07109).

I try to keep everything clean, easily readable and understandable. However, this is still a learning process so there will be imperfections.
